In Next.js 15, a rather uncommon error arises when using the `next/font` package in conjunction with server components and dynamic imports within those components.  The issue manifests as a runtime error, specifically a `TypeError` indicating that a function is not defined, even though the function's import statement appears correct. This often happens when a font is dynamically imported within a server component that's itself imported dynamically into another server component.
