The problem lies in the order and timing of dynamic imports within server components.  To resolve this, avoid dynamic imports for fonts within nested server components. Instead, import the font directly in the main server component or use a more predictable import strategy ensuring the font is available before it's used.  Here's an example:

```javascript
// solution.js
import { Inter } from 'next/font/google'

const inter = Inter({ subsets: ['latin'] })

export default function MyComponent() {
  return (
    <main className={inter.className}>
      <h1>Hello</h1>
    </main>
  )
}
```
This revised approach avoids the dynamic import issue within nested server components, resulting in a stable and error-free rendering.
